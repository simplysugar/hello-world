# hello-world
this is my first time on FreeCodeCamp and I am hoping to learn how to code
My name is Terri and I am unemployed. I am doing this to keep focused on learning and hopefully I will have the ability to teach others what I am learning. I enjoy reading self-help books, sports and arts and graphs. I hope to add coding as one of my abilities and interests.
